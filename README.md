# Data-Structures

These are template header files that I created to use for University projects.

### dictionary.h

A simple dictionary template class that uses an array of structs to store entries.

### linkedList_p.h

A Linked List template class the uses a dummy node. Each node points to the next and previous node.

### queue.h

A queue template class that uses a circular array to store data. The max entries is 15. The next step would be to implement a grow function so the queue can grow dynamically.

### stack.h

A stack template class. This class has not been implemented.
